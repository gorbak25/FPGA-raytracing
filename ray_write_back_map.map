ERROR:Pack:2309 - Too many bonded comps of type "IOB" found to fit this device.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the
   Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for your design
   exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices
   reported may not be reflected accurately as their packing might not have been
   completed.

Interim Summary
---------------
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                    32 out of  81,920    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  20
    Number used as Latch-thrus:                 12
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        689 out of  81,920    1%
    Number used as logic:                      688 out of  81,920    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              93
      Number using O5 output only:              18
      Number using O5 and O6:                  577
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         1
  Number of route-thrus:                        19
    Number using O6 output only:                19

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          689
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           657 out of     689   95%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of     689    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          32 out of     689    4%
    Number of unique control sets:               1
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of  81,920    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                       934 out of     840  111% (OVERMAPPED)
    IOB Flip Flops:                             26

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1
  Number of DSP48Es:                            49 out of     320   15%
