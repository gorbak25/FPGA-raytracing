    Number used as logic:                      364 out of  28,800    1%
      Number using O6 output only:             298
      Number using O5 output only:               2
      Number using O5 and O6:                   64
    Number used as Memory:                       1 out of   7,680    1%
      Number used as Shift Register:             1
        Number using O6 output only:             1
  Number of route-thrus:                         2
    Number using O6 output only:                 2

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   154 out of   7,200    2%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          398
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           233 out of     398   58%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  33 out of     398    8%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         132 out of     398   33%
    Number of unique control sets:               3
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               6 out of  28,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

    Total primitives used:
      Number of 36k BlockRAM used:               3
    Total Memory used (KB):                    108 out of   2,160    5%
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
