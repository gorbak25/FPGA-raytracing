Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         43 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as logic:                       43 out of  28,800    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              43

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    20 out of   7,200    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           43
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            43 out of      43  100%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      43    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:           0 out of      43    0%
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of  28,800    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        38 out of     480    7%

Specific Feature Utilization:

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.11

Peak Memory Usage:  812 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  9 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   8 secs
