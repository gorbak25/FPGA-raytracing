INFO:Xst:741 - HDL ADVISOR - A 25-bit shift register was found for signal <fixed_mul_stage4/output_valid> and currently occupies 25 logic cells (12 slices). Removing the set/reset logic would take advantage of SRL32 (and derived) primitives and reduce this to 1 logic cells (1 slices). Evaluate if the set/reset can be removed for this simple shift register. The majority of simple pipeline structures do not need to be set/reset operationally.
