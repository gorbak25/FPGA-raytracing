Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        293 out of  81,920    1%
    Number used as logic:                      293 out of  81,920    1%
      Number using O6 output only:             200
      Number using O5 output only:               3
      Number using O5 and O6:                   90
  Number of route-thrus:                         3
    Number using O6 output only:                 3

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    88 out of  20,480    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          293
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           293 out of     293  100%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of     293    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:           0 out of     293    0%
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of  81,920    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                       288 out of     840   34%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of DSP48Es:                            24 out of     320    7%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                1.63

Peak Memory Usage:  1067 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  13 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion (all processors):   13 secs
