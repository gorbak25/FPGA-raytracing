Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         95 out of  81,920    1%
    Number used as logic:                       95 out of  81,920    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              93
      Number using O5 and O6:                    2
  Number of route-thrus:                         1
    Number using O5 output only:                 1

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    34 out of  20,480    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           95
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            95 out of      95  100%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      95    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:           0 out of      95    0%
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of  81,920    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                       128 out of     840   15%

Specific Feature Utilization:

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                2.39

Peak Memory Usage:  1052 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  10 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion (all processors):   10 secs 

Mapping completed.
