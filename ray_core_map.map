Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 5,522 out of  20,480   26%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:       19,275
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         7,610 out of  19,275   39%

    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:       9,565 out of  19,275   49%
    Number of unique control sets:              14
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              34 out of  81,920    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
