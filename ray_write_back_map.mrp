  Number of Slice Registers:                    32 out of  81,920    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  20
    Number used as Latch-thrus:                 12
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        689 out of  81,920    1%
    Number used as logic:                      688 out of  81,920    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              93
      Number using O5 output only:              18
      Number using O5 and O6:                  577

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          689
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           657 out of     689   95%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of     689    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          32 out of     689    4%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                       934 out of     840  111% (OVERMAPPED)

Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors   :   2
Number of warnings :  20

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Pack:2309 - Too many bonded comps of type "IOB" found to fit this device.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the
   Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for your design
   exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices
   reported may not be reflected accurately as their packing might not have been
   completed.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:Map:284 - Map is running with the multi-threading option on. Map currently
   supports the use of up to 2 processors. Based on the the user options and
   machine load, Map will use 2 processors during this run.
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network clk_BUFGP/N2 has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 1 more times for the following
   (max. 5 shown):
   clk_BUFGP/N3
   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 0.950 Volts. (default - Range: 0.950 to
   1.050 Volts)

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   2 block(s) removed
   2 block(s) optimized away
   2 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

The signal "clk_BUFGP/N2" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "clk_BUFGP/N3" is sourceless and has been removed.
Unused block "clk_BUFGP/XST_GND" (ZERO) removed.
Unused block "clk_BUFGP/XST_VCC" (ONE) removed.

Optimized Block(s):
TYPE 		BLOCK
GND 		XST_GND
VCC 		XST_VCC

To enable printing of redundant blocks removed and signals merged, set the
detailed map report option and rerun map.
