Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                     1 out of  81,920    1%
    Number used as Latch-thrus:                  1
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        124 out of  81,920    1%
    Number used as logic:                      124 out of  81,920    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              73
      Number using O5 output only:               1
      Number using O5 and O6:                   50
  Number of route-thrus:                         1
    Number using O6 output only:                 1

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    53 out of  20,480    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          124
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           123 out of     124   99%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of     124    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:           1 out of     124    1%
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of  81,920    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                       224 out of     840   26%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of DSP48Es:                            12 out of     320    3%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                1.48

Peak Memory Usage:  1104 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  23 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion (all processors):   23 secs
