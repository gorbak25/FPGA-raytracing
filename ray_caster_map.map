Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                   142 out of  81,920    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                 142
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        631 out of  81,920    1%
    Number used as logic:                      631 out of  81,920    1%
      Number using O6 output only:             538
      Number using O5 and O6:                   93

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   249 out of  20,480    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          654
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           512 out of     654   78%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  23 out of     654    3%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         119 out of     654   18%
    Number of unique control sets:               3
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               6 out of  81,920    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                       603 out of     840   71%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1
  Number of DSP48Es:                            24 out of     320    7%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                1.99

Peak Memory Usage:  1107 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  37 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion (all processors):   38 secs
